                            to record video, images, and audio, and upload them directly to the job, simply by using

                            Foxbuddy is a web based app so you can log in anywhere, anytime. All data, information and
                            media is stored on Foxbuddy's Cloud servers. Using a Cloud service removes the need to buy

                            web based app means you don't have any software to install and gives you 24hr access to your
